<p>We had worked for 55 years in law. We have earned $5,249,949(including tax). We have retired, when Hurricane Ida is heading to us. First, instead of dying, we decided for us and our whole family to evacuate. We will use our Porsche Taycan to drive to Atlanta, GA to pick up our parents. Then, we will use our rented private jet to fly to California, where we will buy a $625,000 dollar house to move in. Once settled, I will invite my friends to a trip around the world. We will get money from New Orleans tax department, due to natural causes. We will sell the property for $100,000.  We will buy furniture. Then we will start a new life in California.</p>
